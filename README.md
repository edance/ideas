### Idea 1

Chatbot very similar to spot. Works as a resume where people can ask the "bot" Evan things about his resume. I would use phoenix for chat.
Everything would route to slack and I could take over when I was available and pretend to be a bot.

### Idea 2

Personal website looks like the no internet connection page for Chrome. Turns into a game where after you lose, there are links to portfolio.

### Idea 3

I liked the landing pages [here][1].

## SuperTuxKart auto driver ##
I really liked this [tutorial][2] and seems pretty ideal. I would like to follow this tutorial but with ruby? and SuperTuxKart.

## Json-Api property management ##
I have done a lot of property management stuff over the last few years. The hardest part was getting the resources correct. This would be an effort to open source that.

## Add missing api endpoints to ruby api.ai ##
It is missing a lot of important parts. I would like to add them one day.

## Facial recognition like snapchat  ##
If SuperTuxKart is possible, this should also be possible. I would like to play around with finding points in space and drawing over the screen.

## Follow/unfollow for github ##
Basic follow/unfollow app for github instead of twitter or instagram.

## Mobile App to mail congress ##
Download the app, from location api get [representative][3], type up a message, send physical mail via [lob][4]. Tech to use:

- Lob
- Quill (text editor)
- Stripe (to process payments)

## Commercial Skipper/Blackout
- Build a hdmi -> hdmi dongle (using a raspberry pi).
- Dongle streams the input directly to the output
- Program listens for breaks in the audio (this will signify cuts/breaks)
- The first X seconds of audio will be fingerprinted and sent to the backend for a match
- If there is a match, mute the signal until the next break.
- Would need to build a service similar to shazam but for commercials
