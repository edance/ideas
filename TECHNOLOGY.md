# List of some technology I want to try

## [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/)

I really like the idea of desktop apps. I'm not really sure why. Basically any project I build, should/could have a desktop app.

## [Anime](http://animejs.com/)

This is an animation library. I would like to make something cool with this. Maybe on my personal website.

## [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

Same thing as I stated with electron, it would be cool to make my own app for things. This seems to be really picking up.

## [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

This is a smaller javascript library that is helpful for rendering components. This is best to integrate in a system like rails where most of the templating is done on the backend.

## [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)

3d animations in javascript.
